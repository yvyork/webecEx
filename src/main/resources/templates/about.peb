        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>This web application is a semester project in the webec modul 2021 at the University of Applied Sciences and Arts Northwestern Switzerland.</p>
        <p>It provides an inventory management for devices. Device information such as</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Manufacturer</li>
            <li>Model</li>
            <li>Serial number</li>
            <li>Processor</li>
            <li>Memory</li>
            <li>Display size</li>
            <li>Purchase date</li>
        </ul>
        <p>can be entered. In addition, location and status information can be selected for the devices.</p>
        <p>New <strong>devices</strong> can be added, the properties can be read and updated and the devices can be
        deleted. It is also possible to change location and status within an existing device.</p>
        <p>A <strong>location</strong> has information like building and room name as well as address information.
        They can be created, read, updated and deleted if no device depends on them.</p>
        <p>The list of <strong>status</strong> are provided with the application and have just a name field. Additionally status can be inserted into the sql configuration file.</p>
        <p>The list of devices and the properties of a device are readable by any application user. To change or edit a
        device you have to log into the web application. The application has a default admin account, which enables
        global access to all CRUD features. Additional accounts can be created but at the moment these accounts have the
        same rights as a non-registered user. This could be configured to certain use cases as one sees fit.</p>

        <h3>Technical preconditions</h3>
        <p>The following general conditions were given for the project work</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The web application uses Spring Boot from the Spring Framework.</li>
            <li>The &quot;Web Model View Controller&quot; design pattern should be implemented.</li>
            <li>Gradle should be used as the build tool.</li>
            <li>Java SDK 17 should be used and code should be written in Java 17.</li>
            <li>The view layer should be implemented with pebble templating engine.</li>
            <li>The Java Persistence API (JPA) and Spring Data JPA should be used for the object-relational mapping.</li>
            <li>The H2 Database should be used for the persistence layer.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Model implementation</h3>
            <p>The model is based on three classes: Device, Location and Status and they are connected
            with two Many-to-One Connections. The following image shows the UML Diagramm.</p>
            <img src="/images/uml_v3.jpg" alt="uml v.3">
        <h3>Testing</h3>
        <p>The functional testing was devided into three types. For <strong>Unit Tests</strong> the JUnit testing
        framework and Mockito for mocking dependencies was used. The <strong>Integration Tests</strong> were written for
         the controller and the repository classes. The Selenium Suite was used to automate Google Chrome browser for <strong>End-to-End Tests<strong>.</p>
